# MidtermMashup
Get a random word, define it, map out addresses you enter in.
Project done mainly on the JS side of things.
(You can ignore most of the methods in the server file, those were just for testing purposes)

APIs used:
- setgetgo : random word generator
- pearson dictionary : defines words
- google maps : take a guess
- google geocode : takes an address (or parts of it) and returns a {latlong}
